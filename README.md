# nft-for-publications is a little dapp created for scientists and researchers around the world to easily mint their reearch work as NFTs.

Research scientist often face some issues for publishing:
1. The publishing system is heavily centralized and acts as gatekeepers preventing a lot of independent research to get exposure and funding.
2. They charge exhorbitant fees to accept publications limiting the number of researches published.
3. Even when published, the publishing companies take all the profit generated from traffic and practically leave peanuts for the researcher. 
4. Access to capital for further reasearch is denied and this stalls a research procedures. 

 With Decentralized sience, minting research works as NFTs solves these issues and more.
 A markekplace where researchers can mint their work as NFTs (erc-721 and erc-1155) would go a long way in giving them the much needed exposure, provide access to funding and capital.
 This also prevents centralization and remove the power of publishing houses. 
 
 The dapp is in developement stage and I will keep working to improve and add better features.
 This is something I am passionate about since I am a pharmacist myself and face similar issues. 
 Many thanks to Bunzz [bunzz.dev] which allowed me to build this without much code. As I gain further understanding of the Bunzz system, I will add further features.
